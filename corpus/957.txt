Gore-Tex takes a plain (unguarded) ePTFE membrane and attaches it to a superthin protective polyurethane (PU) film, creating what is known in the rainwear industry as a bicomponent laminate. The PU layer is solid (technically speaking, monolithic) and shields the ePTFE from body oils and other contaminants.
