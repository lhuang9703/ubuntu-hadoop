Stages of the Swallow. (Logemann, 1983, 1989,1997; Cherney, 1994) The oral preparatory phase. This part of the swallow is voluntary. It is a mechanical phase that can be by-passed by dropping liquid or food into the back of the throat. In this stage, the food is chewed into smaller pieces and tasted.
