Defamation is a catch-all term for any statement that hurts someone's reputation. Written defamation is called libel, and spoken defamation is called slander.. Defamation is not a crime, but it is a tort (a civil wrong, rather than a criminal wrong). A person who has been defamed can sue the person who did the defaming.
