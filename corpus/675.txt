dont pick a lender based on one small fee. it is a legit fee..... though some dont agree that the amt is necessary . if a lender doesnt show that fee on the hud..... then it is hidden in the price of the appraisal. some lenders do not seperate the fees onn the hud... we dont. we include it in the price of the appraisal. less confusing.
