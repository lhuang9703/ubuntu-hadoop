Lake City. Lake City, in central north Floridaâs Columbia County, originally was a Seminole village named Alpata Telophka. Conveniently located between Jacksonville and Tallahassee and near the intersection of I-10 and I-75, Lake City and its natural beauty and outdoor activities attract many visitors. Don't miss the Olustee Battlefield and Museum, about 13 miles east of Lake City.
