1 When performing a pupillary exam, it sometimes helps to illuminate pupils indirectly from the side, so you can actually see what is happening. 2  Observe the pupil size and shape at rest, looking for anisocoria (one pupil larger than the other). 3  Observe the direct response (constriction of the illuminated pupil).
