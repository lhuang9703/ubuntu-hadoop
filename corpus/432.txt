Question: What is the longest word in Spanish? Answer: The answer depends on what you mean by the longest word, but regardless of your definition the longest word isn't superextraordinarÃ­simo, the 22-letter word once listed in a famous recordbook and the word that was usually cited as the longest in the language. (It means most superextraordinary.)
