The classic longest German word is DonaudampfschiffahrtsgesellschaftskapitÃ¤n, which in English becomes four words: Danube steamship company captain.. More than most other languages, German tends to string words together to form new vocabulary. All languages, including English, do this to some extent, but German takes it to new extremes.
