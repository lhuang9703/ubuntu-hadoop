All cord piping is made by hand using premium marine vinyls and foam core (unless specified otherwise by customer). The average cost to completely remove, reupholster/rebuild, and reinstall all associated interior components in a 20 foot runabout is $2,500.00. Similar to the cost of a new couch, loveseat, and coffee table at a reasonably priced furniture store. Of course, prices will vary depending on the boat.
