The ThermaCELL appliance uses a butane cartridge to heat up a small mat thatâs soaked in mosquito repellent. Donât worry â there are no open flames so itâs safe to use around fabric and children. As the mat warms, the repellent is released into the air. Each appliance comes with one butane cartridge and three mats.
