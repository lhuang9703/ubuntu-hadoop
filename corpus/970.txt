Kevin Kent, owner of highly rated Kent Auto Upholstery in Indianapolis, says he charges $175 to $185 for new bolsters. Reupholstering the bottom of the seat typically costs $130 to $350, while reupholstering an entire seat costs about $500 to $600, Zalewski says. âI only touch what I need to touch,â says Zalewski, adding most upholstery damage is limited to areas of heavy usage.
