A person with arm pain experiences soreness, itching, numbness, or discomfort in the structures of the arm. Arm pain is usually caused by an injury, irritation, or inflammation of the skin, muscles, bones, or joints in the arm, although everyday activities, including typing, writing, working with tools, playing sports, lifting heavy objects, or exercising can cause arm pain.
