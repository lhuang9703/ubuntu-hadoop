Surprisingly close! The United States and Russia are just a few kilometers apart! The island of Big Diomede is in Russian territory, and not far away is Little Diomede, which is part of the United States. At their closest points, the two islands are about 3.8 km (2.4 mi) apart. If you could handle the cold water, you could swim from the USA to Russia! See the Google map here:
