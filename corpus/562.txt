Oregon Bottle Bill. Carbonated beverage containers, like the plastic bottles shown here, are sold with refundable deposits. The Oregon Bottle Bill is a container-deposit legislation passed in the U.S. state of Oregon in 1971 and amended in 2007. It requires cans, bottles, and other containers of carbonated soft drink, beer, and (since 2009) water sold in Oregon to be returnable with a minimum refund value.
