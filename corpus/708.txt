So, the answer to your first question is No. Telekinesis is the power to move/control matter with only your mind. Itâs when you show âmind over matterâ, when you have control over atoms/sub-atomic particles/ objects in general. No-one really knows how it works. How does your brain move things you cant actually touch?
