The Language of the Angels. The enochian calls were written in a strange idiom. Some linguists attempted to proof that this language is an artificial construct by John Dee or Edward Kelley.ccording to the angels that spoke during the sessions, the language that appears throughout the enochian calls is the one that was used by the angels that transferred Enoch into heaven. The name of the language and the whole system was named after Enoch.
