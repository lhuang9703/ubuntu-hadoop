If youâre a civilian member, the costs are much higher, often around $55,000 to $70,000 to join and about $290 to $500+ per month depending on the age. On this forum thread at DCUrbanMom.com, a member said they contacted the club as a civilian and was quoted $55,000 for the initiation fee and either $290 per month if under 35 or $520 if older than 35.
