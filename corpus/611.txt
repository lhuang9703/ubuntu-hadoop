How much should I charge for SAT Tutoring? I was thinking of making some money this summer by tutoring kids for the SAT/ACT and other tests. How much do you think I should charge per hour for this tutoring? I got a 2370 on the SAT, three 800s on subject test, and am in the top 1% of my class. Oh, and I'm a rising Senior.
