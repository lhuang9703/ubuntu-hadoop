Your ZIP code is. Hi, my name is Jonatan Heyman. I made this website in a few hours on a train, while commuting to Stockholm. More than once I've needed the zip code/postal code for the place Iâm currently at, and the swedish postal serviceâs website is pretty bad. This is my attempt to solve this problem. I've also made a canadian specific postal code website for finding Canada postal codes.
