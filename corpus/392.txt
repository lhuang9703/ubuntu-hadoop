In 16:9, the problematic elegxo occurs: âin every instance the verb has to do with showing someone his sin, usually as a summons to repentanceâ (Carson, John, 537). Therefore, to convict the world is shaming it and attempting to persuade it of its guiltiness, and in this way âcalling it to repentanceâ (ibid.).
