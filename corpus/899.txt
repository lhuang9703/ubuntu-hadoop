Many places also have a count of the number of days with wet weather. The calculation of days only includes those when precipitation amounted to at least 0.1 millimetres (0.004 inches). The annual amount of precipitation is an average of weather data collected during 1981 to 2010. You can jump to a separate table for each region of the country: North Netherlands, East Netherlands, West Netherlands and South Netherlands. North Netherlands covers the provinces of Groningen, Friesland and Drenthe.
