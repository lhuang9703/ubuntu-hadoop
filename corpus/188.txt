Often they are people who won't try something new themselves or like to make themselves feel better by making others feel worse. Ignore put-downs from other people! Don't use put-downs yourself! Just have a go and feel happy when you manage to do something or get better at something that you have been practising.ne thing is for sure and that is that money cannot make a person happy, nor can having all the things that anyone could want. Happiness is more about feelings and interactions with other people than having things.
