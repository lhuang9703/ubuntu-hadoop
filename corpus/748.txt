This plan included 2 other conspirators,Nedjelko Cabrinovic, and Trifko Grabez, though they obviously all failed in their assasination attempts. The original plan was that these 3 people would kill the Archduke while he was driving though the streets of Sarajevo on his way to visit the city hall. Nedjelko, who made the first attempt, threw a grenade at the Archduke's car, but it instead missed, rolled underneath another car in the motorcade, and exploded.
