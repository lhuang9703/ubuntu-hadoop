Pentecost, near the end of the grain harvest, included grain and loaf offerings (verses 16-17). Pentecost was also called âthe Feast of Harvestâ (Exodus 23:16). Barley and wheat were planted in the autumn and ripened in spring. Barley matured faster and would be harvested sooner. The firstfruits of grain offered during the Festival of Unleavened Bread would have been barley.
