Hey, I heard that lipton tea is the best, but I want to know which flavor is the best,. Thanks. If you're limited to Lipton, I would say go for the pyramid style bags if you can find them. The bedtime story blend is actually pretty decent. If you're limited to tea bags, my advice would be to go for a loose leaf tea and just purchase a reusable tea bag to place the loose leaf tea in.
