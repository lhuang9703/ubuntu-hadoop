One part of the documentary covered Lipton tea and how it's made from many blends of tea. Up to 40 different kinds of black tea. So your lipton tea is basically a blend to get that lipton taste, so you never know where it's from or what kind of black tea it is. A tea taster would sip different teas and give them a number, then they would blend them according to these numbers to get that familiar taste.
