Note: The Kolomoki Site in southern Georgia appears to be a transitional site from Woodland Indians to Moundbuilders and is not included in the list. The most intact Mississippian Cultural site in the East is the Etowah Indian Mounds State Historic Site. The site was recognized as a De Soto Trail Site by the U.S. Department of the Interior in 1989 and is an anchor site on northwest Georgia's Chieftains Trail and is located in Bartow County, Georgia.
