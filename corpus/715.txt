What is the ThermaCELL Mosquito Repellant Appliance? âApplianceâ is a strange name but itâs hard to come up with something better. Itâs an 8â by 3â device that emits a repellant that keeps mosquitoes and black flies away. Thereâs no need to spray yourself and thereâs hardly any odor.
