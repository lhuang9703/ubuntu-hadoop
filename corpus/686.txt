What is the difference between libel and slander? Libel and slander are both forms of defamation. Defamation is a common law tort, governed by state law, in which an individual makes a publication of a defamatory statement of and concerning the plaintiff that damages the reputation of the plaintiff. The distinction between slander and libel comes in the form of the publication. Slander involves the oral publication of a defamatory remark that is heard by another, which injures the subject's reputation or character. Slander can occur through the use of a hand gesture or verbal communication that is not recorded.
