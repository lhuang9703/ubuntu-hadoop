A blood level of acetaminophen higher than 200 mcg/mL 4 hours after ingestion means there is risk for liver damage. If the test shows a level of 50 mcg/mL or greater 12 hours after you've taken the drug, there is still risk for liver damage. Overdose levels for children are based on age and weight.
