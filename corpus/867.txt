Those interested in a terminal Masterâs degree should apply to the Master of Engineering program; others may apply for the combined MS/PhD program. Competition for these assistantships and fellowships is very keen and in general only about 5% of new M.S. (/Ph.D.) applicants will receive an offer of financial aid.
