Though the default programs inventory isnât specific to Internet programs, you will find Internet programs in the list. Choose from the list the program you want to use as your web browser. One example is Firefox. Choose the option Set This Program As Default. Repeat Steps 3 and 4 for your email program. Click OK. Whenever you install new Internet software, such as a new email program or web browser, it typically asks whether you want it to be the âdefault.â
