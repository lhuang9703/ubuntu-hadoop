One of the biggest perks of an Amazon Prime membership is free two-day shipping and, for some zip codes in major cities, free same-day delivery on eligible items with no minimum order size. Additionally, one-day shipping can cost as little as $2.99 per item, and Saturday shipping as low as $7.99 per item.
