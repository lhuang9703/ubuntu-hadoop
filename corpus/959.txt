All rainwear exteriors (also known as face fabrics) are treated with a durable water repellent (DWR) finish. Even rainwear classified as water-resistant (which includes soft shells) carries a DWR finish. A DWR affects only the exterior of rainwear and is separate from a laminate or coating. Its purpose is to protect the face fabric from becoming saturated, weighing it down and causing any sensation of dampness. A DWR accomplishes this by causing water to bead up and roll off the garment's exterior.
